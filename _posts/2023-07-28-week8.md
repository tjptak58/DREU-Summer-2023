This week we started coding the study we created last week. We're building the project in MatLab and are using different toolkits to implement our ideas. I'm focusing on the backend and the signal processing while my partner is working on the user interface. The split worked out really well because we're both working on what we're interested in. We also ran our focus group with the firefighters from Gainesville Fire and Rescue. It went great! We learned a lot about how S&R operates in the real world along with how tech could improve it.
