title: Week 8

This week we started coding the study we created last week. We're building the project in MatLab and are using different toolkits to implement our ideas. I'm focusing on the backend and the signal processing while my parter is working on the user interface. The split worked out really well beacuse we're both working on what we're interested in. We're about half way done with one week to go so next week is going to be a cram to finish it all up.
