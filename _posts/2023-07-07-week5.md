This week we finished running our first studies and developing focus group questions for the Audio REScue project. We also got our first programming assignment. My partner Michael and I were tasked to come up with a study to test what rate of 3-D sound movement can be detected in real-world situations. Today we spent the day reading papers on the subject and brainstorming how we could test for our question.
