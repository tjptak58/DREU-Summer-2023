title: Week 3

This week I continued running studies for Armisha and started gathering information about firefighters. Dr. McMullen and Armisha are the PI and Co-PI for a research project called CAREER: Audio RESCUE. They're looking for a way to use 3-D audio to aid first responders in complex environments. We're planning on testing these ideas with local firefighters. My job this week was to find out what firefighters do during search and rescue operations.
