This week we designed a prototype of the moving sound experiemnt to be implemented in MatLab. The study is a Within-groups Study (Repeated Measures). The sound is a moving object (a triangle wave at 400Hz) starting somewhere in front of the participant and moving left or right. The indepent variables are movement speed (10°/s, 20°/s, 40°/s, 80°/s, 160°/s, and 320°/s), distance (near field and far field), noise ratios (0%, 50%), and angular movement ( 5°, 20°, 40°, 60°, 90°, 120°). I'm in charge of the signal proccessing and backend of the project.
