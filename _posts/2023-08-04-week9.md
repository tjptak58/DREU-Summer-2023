This week was my last one and I finished up my part of the code for the audio REScue project. I was in charge of the signal processing for the study and I was able to create moving sounds based off the testing conditions. While the study isn't all the way finished, we've made a lot of progress. I spent the rest of the week writing my final report and uploading my files into the lab drive for them to ue when we're gone.
