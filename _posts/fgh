This week, I started learning MatLab using an online course through Linkedin Learning. The course taught me the basic syntax of the language along with ways to use it for my research. We plan to use this knowledge to develop new studies. I also got started helping a PhD student with her lab tests. She's running a study to see which sonic cues effect sound source localization and I'm in charge of proctoring the test with my partner. Outside of that, I'm trying to pick up as much signal processing knowledge as I can while I'm here.
