This week I continued running studies for Audio REScue and gathered more information on firefighters. On Thursday, our PI Dr. McMullen came in and we presented what we learned about firefighter search and rescue. She and Armisha gave us notes and direction for what to keep and what to change. We also started developing questions for a focus group we're holding for the Gainesville Fire Department.
