This week, I familarized myself with the nature and application of sound - specifically 3-D audio. I learned the physics behind sound waves and applications of the fourier transform / fast fourier transform. I then studied the ways natural spatial hearing is digitally simulated in 3-D audio systems. I learned about the methods in which sound images are manipulated and the difficulties that can come with these methods. I also spent time learning how to use MatLab and its application for signal processing.
