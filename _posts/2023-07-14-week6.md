This week we continued thinking about how we were going to design our portion of the study. The study is to determine what rate of 3-D sound movement can be reliably detected. A sound can be detected reliably if its starting position and ending position can be determined within 5 degree of error. We spent a lot of time reading papers to understand common methods for testing this accuracy. We found a couple studies and decided to implement methods similar to Han & Chen (2019). We plan on coding a prototype of the study in MatLab next week in MatLab
