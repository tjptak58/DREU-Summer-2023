## About Me

My name is Tyler "TJ" Ptak and I'm a sophmore studying computer science at Purdue University. I'm also considering getting a concentration in music technology. Email: tylerptak@gmail.com

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Dr. Kyla McMullen, an associate professor and the director of the SoundPad Lab at the University of Florida. She's works on using signal processing to render 3-D audio and using that audio to sonify virtual environments.

## About My Project

I'm working on the Audio RESCUE project : Realistic Audio for RESponders in Complex Undetermined Environments. The study hopes to learn which sonic cues could assist firefighters and first responders in complex situations.
