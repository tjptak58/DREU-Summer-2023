## About My Mentor

My mentor is Dr. Kyla McMullen, an associate professor and the director of the SoundPad Lab at the University of Florida. She's works on the applications of sound and specifically 3-D audio. She also does a lot of work on diversity and equity in higher education.

I'm working on the Audio RESCUE project : Realistic Audio for RESponders in Complex Undetermined Environments. The study hopes to develop interfaces to assist first responders during critical situations. The first application is an interface to aid firefighters during search and rescue operations.
